# Name
Jrive - Drive Journal
Personal motivation coach

## Mission statement
To be the go-to place for users to fuel their inner fire! It's all about collecting, reflecting on, and being reminded of what inspires them. Think of it as a personal wellspring of motivation.

## Ideas
### Features
* This is like a grander vision board with motivations.
* Users can always add things that motivate and inspire them (add tags to these sources)
* These items + original goal motivation are used for when motivation is low or lacking
* Users can choose how often they want to be reminded of an inspiration
* Categorization of goals for more data points, and potentially community of ppl with similar goals, and then ppl can share their successes and stories, and advice and maybe then a goals with milestones breakdown can be useful.
* Occasionally, users can receive a push notification to remind them to log their motivation levels in their journal (this is so that the user will always be reminded of their goals and to stay on track with them) (maybe don't need to check in and just remind ppl to look at their motivations)
* Inspiration challenges: e.g. Mindset monday. something maybe where we prompt the user weekly to be finding new sources of inspo or 

### UI
* Section for my reasons/motivations (horizontal scroll view)
* Section for things that inspire (horizontal scroll view)
* Make it more vision board vibe somehow

### My personal use case as an example
* Stay inspired to be building things and inspired for my vision of my future (creating and being smth great)


## Qs
* Who is the target audience here? Dreamers, Seekers of Positivity, Creatively Inclined (creative inspiration)


## BUGS
