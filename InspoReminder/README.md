Vision

## Mission statement
To be the go-to place for users to fuel their inner fire! It's all about collecting, reflecting on, and being reminded of what inspires them. Think of it as a personal wellspring of motivation.
* It is a smart vision board: includes reminders, structure, and goal-oriented vs inspiration view.
* This is like a grander vision board with motivations.


## BUGS
* Add image: cancel button doesnt work and should be at the top left corner of the sheet
* In reminder page, "-- days hours mins until next reminder" not correct


## Paid: AI Features (Something AI is good at is being a yes man)
* AI motivational speech generation
* AI text to inspirational sounding audio generation


### Must Features
******** COMMUNITY INSPIRATIONS (SORT BY CATEGORY), users can share theirs by pressing shared vs not shared button on the inspiration, default is non-shared (YES AND we can get users through reddit and other platforms for driven ppl)
* Share the spark: Allow users to share their inspirations (sharable collections maybe?)
* Accounts for easier payments in the future. And firebase for storage.
* Inspiration of the day/week (choose one inspiration at random from a random goal, the notifs is to remind ppl of the goal itself)

### Could consider features
* "Inspiration Remix": This could be a fun feature where the app combines different elements of a user's saved inspirations. For example, it could overlay a favorite quote on top of an inspiring image they've uploaded, or create a short audio clip of inspiring words they've saved. This could offer a fresh perspective on their existing content.

### Future features
* Categorization of goals for more data points, and potentially community of ppl with similar goals, and then ppl can share their successes and stories, and advice and maybe then a goals with milestones breakdown can be useful.
* Video and audio inspirations
* Given these motivations, ai generate some new motivations?



### My personal use case as an example
* Stay inspired to be building things and inspired for my vision of my future (creating and being smth great)
